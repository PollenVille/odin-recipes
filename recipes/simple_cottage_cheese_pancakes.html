        <p>These pancakes are an old favorite of mine. I use small-curd, low-fat cottage cheese. They come out thin and delicate, somewhere between a classic pancake and a crepe. A nice addition to a reduced-carb diet.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 cup cottage cheese</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup blueberries, or to taste (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Strain cottage cheese in a sieve fitted over a bowl, pressing down occasionally, until cottage cheese has dried out, about 1 hour.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Beat eggs in a medium bowl; add cottage cheese, flour, melted butter, and salt. Mix until just blended.</p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Heat butter in a frying pan over medium-high heat; drop large spoonfuls of batter into the melted butter. Sprinkle blueberries into batter. Cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</p>
